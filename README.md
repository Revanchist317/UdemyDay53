This is a tiny project showcasing web scraping and driving a website via Selenium in the context of automating Google form filling. It first extracts info from an online portal for real estate and then fills this info into a form. See [here](https://youtu.be/BdPUj7b38fA) for a quick demonstration. 
This project is part of the course 100 days of Code, hosted by Udemy (hence the title) - you can access it [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
